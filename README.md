# Project Guess Who, Week 5
This week we are building a classic "Guess Who" game and
digging deaper into JavaScript with objects, arrays and functions.
Some of the learnings:
- Create and manipulate objects
- Create and manipulate arrays
- Array methods such as `forEach()` and `filter()`
- More about manipulating the DOM using Javascript
- How to structure your code in functions
- How to plan and think about game logic

## The problem

I really got stuck and struggled with the filter functions and arrays. First I used true and false and the game worked fine but after wednesday class I wanted to change it into []. Then I only got errors and undifined messeges.. But after talking to one of my fellow Zebras we solved my problems using a code-solution she came up with that also worked for me.
